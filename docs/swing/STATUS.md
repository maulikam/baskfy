## SW0 — Baseline and read-in ✅

Everything below was **measured on this machine on 2 Sep 2026**, not recalled. A reader with no
other context should be able to name the tables, suites, data date and flags this run builds on
from this section alone.

### Repository

| | |
|---|---|
| Branch | `developer`, HEAD `4e2c7ba` ("M81/M82: connecting pulls the holdings…") |
| Trees | `decile-blueprint/` (screener + API + worker + web), `kite-momentum-rebalancer/` (the desk), `frozen/strangle/` (untouched) |
| **Another session's dirty files** | `decile-blueprint/apps/web/src/app/(app)/portfolio/activity/page.tsx` and its `__tests__/` were modified before this run started. **They are not this run's and are not committed under any SW module.** |
| Pack files adopted by this run | `docs/swing/*`, the `.env.example` swing block, `packages/core/src/baskfy_core/swing/` and `packages/core/tests/{swing_fixtures,test_swing_*}.py` |

### Both suites, at baseline

| Suite | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| The desk | `DRY_RUN=true .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` in `kite-momentum-rebalancer/` | **1330 passed, 17 skipped, 12 subtests passed**, 54.8 s, exit 0 |
| The screener | `uv run pytest -q` in `decile-blueprint/` | **3383 passed, 1184 skipped, 0 failed** (see the note below on how this was counted) |

Two things a future session needs to know about the screener run:

1. **Do not `source .env` before running it.** The first baseline run of this session did, and
   two provider tests failed — `test_cli_doctor.py::test_kite_is_reported_unavailable_with_the_reason`
   and `test_kite.py::test_unconfigured_is_unavailable_not_an_exception`. Both assert the message
   an *unconfigured* Kite provider produces; with `BASKFY_KITE_API_KEY` exported into the shell,
   the provider gets further and reports a different (correct) reason. The failures are an
   artefact of the shell, not of the tree: the same suite run without the export is green.
2. **The suite prints no final summary line** (`N passed in Xs`) on a full run — the last thing
   on stdout is the `[100%]` progress line. It does print one for any subset. The counts above
   were therefore taken by counting the progress characters (3517 `.` and 1184 `s` over 4701
   collected) and subtracting the **134 tests this session had already added** before the count
   was taken (`test_swing_docs_parity.py`, 109; the twelve new `sw_` rows in
   `test_schema_matches_docs.py`, 25). This quirk is pre-existing and not investigated; it is
   recorded here so the next session does not read a missing summary as a crash.

Swing core, measured separately under the repo's own `uv` environment (this is SW1's evidence,
recorded here because it was run during the baseline): **103 passed** across the seven
`test_swing_*.py` files, **8 passed** for `test_no_escape_hatches.py`, `ruff check` and
`ruff format --check` clean over 18 files, `mypy --strict` clean over the same 18.

### Data and schema

| | |
|---|---|
| Alembic head in the repository | `0027_instrument_null_dedup` |
| Alembic head in the local dev database (`baskfy` on `localhost:5433`) | `0026_auth_identity` — **the dev database is one migration behind the tree**; `make migrate` before any SW3+ work against it |
| `ohlcv_daily` in the local dev database | 1,800 rows, **2026-08-17 → 2026-08-28**, 180 instruments |
| `factor_daily` in the local dev database | **0 rows** |
| `instrument` | 200 rows |
| Latest `pipeline_run.data_version` | 104 |
| The `baskfy-staging-*` compose stack | running, but its Postgres is at `0024_portfolio_kind_default` with **no instruments and no bars** — it is not the staging box `GATES.md` G6 refers to |

**This is the single most important fact for SW3.** Ten sessions of bars cannot feed a detector
that needs 125. SW3's acceptance criterion "a `sw_setup_daily` row for a real date exists on the
dev stack" cannot be met by the data currently on this machine; SW3 says what it did about that.

### Flags and safety

| | |
|---|---|
| `kite-momentum-rebalancer/.env` | `DRY_RUN=true` |
| `decile-blueprint/.env` | no `DRY_RUN` key (the screener places nothing; law 2) |
| `BASKFY_SWING_EXECUTION_ENABLED` | documented `false` in the root `.env.example`, unset in every `.env` |
| `BASKFY_SWING_MONITOR_ENABLED` | same |
| `BASKFY_SWING_EP_PREMARKET_ENABLED` | same |
| `INTRADAY_ENABLED` / `OPTIONS_ENABLED` | `false` (desk `config.py` defaults; unset in `.env`) |
| Kite token | not exercised in this run; no live order path was touched |

### The Beat schedule this run adds to

`baskfy_worker.celery_app.BEAT_SCHEDULE`, IST, as of the baseline — 17 entries. The ones the
swing jobs sit beside:

| Entry | When |
|---|---|
| `refresh-reference-data` (`baskfy.pipeline.nightly`) | 18:45 Mon–Fri |
| `cb-eod-metrics` | 20:20 Mon–Fri |
| `cb-dividends` | 20:25 Mon–Fri |
| `dispatch-screen-alerts` | 20:30 Mon–Fri |
| `portfolio-eod-nav` | 20:35 Mon–Fri |
| `cb-sip-reminders` | 09:00 Mon–Fri |
| `cb-rebalance-notify` | 09:30 Mon–Fri |
| `weekly-integrity-audit` | Sat 02:00 |
| `kite-token-expiry` | hourly at :05 |

So `swing-premarket` (08:50/09:09), the monitor window (09:15–10:45), `swing-eod` (after
publish) and `swing-weekend` (Sat 07:00) land in gaps rather than on top of anything.

### What SW0 changed

Nothing executable. The `docs/swing/` pack is committed so the run has a specification in the
repository rather than in a session's context.

## Not done (kept loud)

- **Everything from SW1 on.** No migration applied to the dev database, no worker task, no
  router, no page, no desk route, no monitor, no backtest, no goldens.
- The core's flag score does not yet include the `+5/+5` (young listing / hot sector) of `04`
  §2.6 — that is SW3's, because it needs `instrument.listed_on` and `index_member_daily`, which
  core must not read.
- `sw_config.first_live_sessions_left` / `risk_multiplier` (`02` §3.5) has no core function yet;
  SW7 multiplies `risk_per_trade_pct` before calling `size_position`.
- The dev database holds ten sessions of bars for 180 instruments and **no factor rows**. Every
  "on the dev stack" acceptance criterion in SW3–SW5 has to reckon with that.
